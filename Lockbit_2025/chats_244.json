Our currency has lost almost all its value \u2014 people here are struggling just to survive. Paying 5 BTC per server is not just difficult, it\u2019s completely impossible for me. Even saving 0.1 BTC would take years here.\nThis situation has destroyed everything I\u2019ve worked for. I am desperate and broken. Please understand that I\u2019m not your enemy \u2014 I\u2019m just a small person in a very hard place, trying to find a way forward.\nIf there is any way you could help, or reduce the amount, or show any mercy, I would be deeply grateful. I am willing to cooperate or discuss any possible solution that is humanly possible for me.\nThank you for reading. I truly hope you will show some mercy.",

If there was a way to pay in Toman, I could try to gather something, but I know it may not be useful to you.\n\nPlease, I am desperate. I\u2019m not trying to avoid responsibility \u2014 I just need a chance to recover even part of what I\u2019ve lost. If you can reduce the amount to something that someone like me could possibly afford, I will do everything I can to make it happen.\n\nThis is my last hope.
