We can directly delete the suffix and the file can be used, or change it to the correct suffix and decrypt it without affecting its use. 2: When the encryption of a file is correct, we need to change its abnormal suffix to a normal one to decrypt it correctly. After the file is decrypted, it is normal. 3: If the file encryption process stops and the file is damaged, and we change it to a normal suffix,\nit will not be decrypted either, because the file itself is not fully encrypted and its encrypted information is incomplete, so it will not be decrypted ",
