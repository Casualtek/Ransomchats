After launching, the decryptor deletes the executable file and is demonetized, so that you cannot run the decryptor again and damage the files, this is normal.\n\nIf you have more than one ESXi host then you should not run the decryptor on all hosts simultaneously, make the decryption alternately, in the case of simultaneous operation of two decryptors may corrupt files and not be able to decrypt\n\nIf any files in another folder stay crypted, please use this command with path\nExample:\n.\/decrypt -i \/tmp\/files1\/",
