You can select 1-3 small files from the list and they will be provided to you as proof. You can also send 1-3 small encrypted files and we will decrypt them as proof of the decryption capability. After that, we will discuss the amount you will pay to receive the decryptor and delete the files we downloaded from you. If we do not reach an agreement before the expiration of the timer that you see, the data taken will be published, and the decryption program will be deleted. It is impossible to decrypt without this program, after removing the decryptor, even we will not be able to do it.

This would weaken our position in the negotiations and strengthen yours. For the same reason, waiting until the last minutes of the timer and trying to use that to reduce the amount will not work. Our blog has several examples of chats where people have tried to do this, but it didn't work out. The best strategy now is to do everything as quickly as possible, which will make us as flexible as possible in our ability to negotiate.",

The usual timeline is to enter into negotiations 1-2 days after the incident, to deal with the files within 2-6 hours, and then proceed to discuss payment. Within 8 days, we haven't made progress with checking the files and haven't started discussing payment. It's surprising, since companies with your profile are popular, judging by our download statistics. And such companies usually try to resolve the issue literally over the first weekend, so that by the beginning of the week, no one notices the incident. You have been provided with a single list, which you will see, and the rest you will be able to view on our blog in a week, if the negotiations are not successful.",

We likely would have had this entire situation resolved by now if you would just provide what we're asking for. This just seems very strange, and it is making it difficult to understand your true motives or trust that you will be able to help us.
