Dragging and dropping an encrypted file or folder with encrypted files onto the decryptor file.\nIn this mode, the console window will open automatically, which will display the decryption process.\n\nCommand line examples:\n> decryptor.exe -all\n> decryptor.exe -path C:\\Folder\n> decryptor.exe -path C:\\Folder\\file.txt.[redacted]\n            \n\nwin_decryptor.exe\n76.5 kB",
