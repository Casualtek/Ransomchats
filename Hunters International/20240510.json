We did buy Bitcoin then for the potential situation we are in right now. My boss does not want to waste money or time on this any longer and is willing to pay you that Bitcoin so we can all walk away today. As you know banks are closed today and tomorrow due to holiday, so we only have what Bitcoin we have to work with. We can send you $1,500,000 within hours.
