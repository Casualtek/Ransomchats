My client is trying to cope with\n this difficult situation, since it has been heavily struck by the \ncurrent economic crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a dramatic\n fall of sales in the last months. My client\u2019s net revenues amount to \nEUR 500.000,00 in the last financial statement (2.5 billion as gross \nrevenues, which is a not relevant data if you guys are acquainted with \neconomics). The financial situation of my client has been catastrophic \nsince 2010, with a substantial decrease y/y in net revenues and gross \noperating profits. The cyberattack you have carried out on my client\u2019s \nsystems has blocked the company operation and all its internal \noperations have been shut down including deliveries, and as a \nconsequence my client is not able to fulfil the market with its copper \nproducts and get revenues. My client has already had to make budget cuts\n and fire many of its employees or put them on unemployed insurance, \nwith devastating effects on families and children amid the economic \ncrisis due to Covid19. Therefore, it is impossible for my client to pay \nyou 7.5 million USD. According to my client\u2019s financial condition, I \nthink he might be considering paying a certain amount in order to \nprotect his business and to obtain the decrypting tool for all the files\n very quickly. However, such amount would be lower than the one you have\n requested, due to the heavy financial situation. In my personal \nopinion, my client has the financial availability to pay you 500.000 USD\n very quickly. A greater amount would be very difficult (almost \nimpossible in my very personal opinion) to be paid because of the \ncurrent financial situation. Let me know on this point.",

In\n the consolidated financial report you exfiltrated you can see that in \nthe first three months of 2020 only the financial loss amounts to EUR \n[redacted] M. And take a look at the net financial position as at 31 March \n2020 which is negative by EUR [redacted] M. Moreover, look at bond trading \nlevel (30% yield) that my client needs to repay: \n[redacted]. The\n financial situation of my client is negative. I think you picked the \nwrong victim and the financial analysis you have performed prior to \nundertaking the hacking operations is absolutely wrong. Look at the \nchart herein attached and maybe you will be able to understand that \neconomics is not hacking and my client is not Grubman nor Travelex nor \n[redacted] (the latter, just to remain in the [redacted] boundaries and a victim \nyou may know).\nWith regard to the insurance manual you guys have exfiltrated please \nnote that the insurance company Chubb does not cover the expenses \nrelated to a ransom payment but only the expenses my client is is facing\n for business interruption and recovery.\nThis being said, my client needs to resume normal operations as soon as \npossible minimising financial losses due to inactivity caused by your \nactions. So we need to find a trade-off between your requests and my \nclient\u2019s capability to pay. Too much money requested and really my \nclient does not have that financial capability. My client understands \nyour position and aspirations but can\u2019t reach that amount. Overnight I \nconvinced my client to add more money on the table. His offer now \namounts to 750.000,00 but this will entail more sacrifices in terms of \nemployment and debt repayment. People will be fired amid this financial \ncrisis but I guess you guys don\u2019t care about people left without \nlivelihood.\nIf you guys don\u2019t accept it, my client will set up the new \ninfrastructure without data. It won\u2019t be easy but my client is pretty \nsure to go back on the business within a few weeks. I mean my client is \nmaking the argument that the cost to restart the new infrastructure \nwithout data will not be higher than 700-800 k USD. That amount \nrepresents the break-event point for my client. If my client pays a \ndollar more, it won\u2019t be convenient for him. So accept these 750 k USD \nor set a new affordable price or get nothing. If you accept or if you \nset a price which my client is able to meet, he will start the payment \nprocess as soon as possible, after finding a trusted exchange. \nPlease stop the countdown as usual during the negotiations with your hacking group.",

What I am trying to let you understand is that my client is \nnot in a good financial position and the financial statement you have \nhad to chance to read clearly testifies what I am saying. The production\n plants are on hold and people are put on unemployed insurances and are \nbeing fired. I know that you guys don\u2019t care because your goal is your \npersonal profit. You carried out a perfect and clean job on my client\u2019s \nnetwork I have been told and you clearly deserve to be rewarded for your\n work. The issue is not if my client is willing to pay but how much \nmoney my client can afford to pay without worsening his financial \ncondition and safeguarding jobs and families. This is the main issue. \nYou guys are considering the data exfiltrated as valuable data that may \ncause a catastrophic reputational damage to my client if disclosed to \nthe general public. Well, this is not the case. My client is not \ninterested if you guys disclose [redacted] email dump or NDAs or whatever\n document you have in your hands. The value of the data you guys have \nstolen is irrelevant to my client. My client resells commodities ([redacted]) with a B2B model, there\u2019s no industrial secret to be \nprotected. And again, please believe me that I\u2019m not bluffing on this \npoint. You have read the documents you have stolen and you guys are \nexperienced in the field: I bet you haven\u2019t found any information worth \nUSD 6.75 M. Any. So again, my client is interested in a quick restore of\n its network. Analysts have estimated that to restore the systems from \nscratch it will cost around EUR 800 k. Than there is the business \ninterruption which is also covered by the insurance policy you have had \nthe chance to read. If my client gets the decrypter, the network will be\n restored faster and the business will restart in a matter of days. \nOtherwise it will take longer but the costs incurred by my client will \nbe integrally covered by the cybersecurity insurance policy.\nThis being said, we are at a negotiation table. Your demands (USD 6.75 \nM) do not match our last offer (USD 750k ). We are way too far to reach \nan agreement. You guys say that our last offer do not you\u2019re your \nexpectations and to come back with a higher offer. But you guys have not\n lowered your request and showed any availability to reach an agreement \nand a win-win solution for both the parties involved. I mean, this is \nnot a negotiation. Are you guys willing to get a reward for your team? \nWhat if I convince my client to put USD 1 M on the table? My client will\n never pay you the amount you have requested, but with some sacrifice he\n might be able to reach the USD 1 M threshold.",

Decryptor looking for encrypted file\n2. creating backup of file\n3. decrypting file\n4. removing the backup\n5. looking for a next file and loop repeating.\n\nYou can collect list of extensions, input to the textarea above the chat\n and click \"Download\" to generate General decryptor to decrypt files \nwith these extensions.\nBut this way is not necessary, because we provide you the universal \ndecryptor.
